## Installation

The application requires [Java 11](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) to execute properly.

This project uses [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) as build tool. You need to [install](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) it. Apache Maven will be used throughout this documentation to install, configure and execute the application.

First you need to install the dependencies using your favorite shell:

```shell
// TODO: Show here how to setup the project using Apache Maven
```

Once dependencies are installed you can build the project:

```shell
// TODO: Show here how to setup the project using Apache Maven
```

This command will generate a JAR file in the `target/` directory.

## Usage

To use the created JAR file, you can use the following command:

```shell
// TODO: Show here how to use the application without any build tool
```

Or if you prefer Apache Maven:

```shell
// TODO: Show here how to use the application with Apache Maven
```
